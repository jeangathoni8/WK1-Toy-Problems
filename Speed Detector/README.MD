# Speed Detector Challenge

## Overview
The Speed Detector is a web application designed to evaluate the speed of a vehicle and determine if it's within legal limits. It provides feedback based on the speed input, such as "Ok" for speeds less than 70 km/h, and calculates demerit points for speeds above this threshold. The application aims to promote safe driving by alerting drivers when they exceed speed limits and risk license suspension.

## Features
- **Speed Input**: Users can input the speed of their vehicle.
- **Speed Evaluation**: The application evaluates if the speed is within the legal limit.
- **Demerit Points Calculation**: For speeds over the limit, the application calculates demerit points at a rate of 1 point for every 5 km/h above 70 km/h.
- **Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback to the user:
  - If the speed is below 70 km/h, it prints "Ok".
  - For speeds above 70 km/h, it prints the total demerit points as "Points: X".
  - If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, it prints "License suspended".

## Implementation
This application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple interface for entering vehicle speed and displaying results.

## Usage
1. Enter the vehicle speed in the designated input field.
2. Submit the speed to receive feedback on your driving.
3. The application will display whether your speed is within the limit, the number of demerit points if any, and if your license is at risk of being suspended.
